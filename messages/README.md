## Lab 6 -- Messages == AJAX ##

1. To my knowledge, the entirety of this lab has been implemented correctly
   The JSON file is received via an XML HTTP request and parsed and formatted
   to the webpage all through JavaScript code.

2. I did not collaborate with anyone else on this lab. I used the references
   provided from the lab handout along with Ming's lectures.

3. I spent approximately an hour on this lab.

4. It is not possible to request data from a different origin because XML HTTP
   Requests abide to the same-origin policy. This would be a serious security
   vulnerability if I could have the ability to do this.
