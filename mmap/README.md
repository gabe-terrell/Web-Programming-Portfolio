## The Real Marauder's Map -- API & AJAX Practice ##

1. To my knowledge, the entirety of this assignment has been implemented correctly:
		- Geolocater is used to find my location
		- XHR is used to send my location to Ming's Database and receive other's locations
		- Google Maps is used to display everyone's location and distance from me

2. I did not collaborate with anyone else on this assignment. I did, however, consult
   Ming's examples very frequently, use the resources provided on the assignment page,
   and consult stackoverflow/google API for debugging. I provided sources for any
   code I borrowed or drew inspiration from.

3. I spent approximately 5 hours on this assignment.
