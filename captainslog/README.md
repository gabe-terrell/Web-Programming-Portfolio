## Lab 7 -- Captain's Log -- JQuery & Data Persistance ##

1. To my knowledge, the entirety of this lab has been implemented correctly.
   The page takes entries from the input textbox, timestamps them, stores them,
   and produces a messagelog showing the most recent message. Upon page refresh,
   the log can still be reduced due to local storage.

2. I did not collaborate with any other student on this assignment. I did frequently
   consult StackOverflow for JQuery referencing and input semantics. I also consulted
   Ming's GitHub resources and rhe resources provided in the Lab handout.

3. I spent approximately an hour working on this assignment.
